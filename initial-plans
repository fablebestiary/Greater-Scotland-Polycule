all information will be given by users who sign up. so they will have accounts
each account should have the following information:

* ID
- unique display/[username] (essential)
- actual [name] (probably won't usually be shown) (optional)
- [email address] (essential)
- [password] (essential)
- [pfp] (optional)

* Connections
(none essential but if they have no connections their account won't be shown on the map)
each [connection] will be logged/kept track of by [username]
connections include:
- [partners]
- [dates]
- [other]: whatever a user deems worthy of a connection
(there will be space to type in how a user describes their connection)

* Statistics (for fun data vis purposes)
all statistical information will be optional
- [gender] (multichoice, option to add identity)
- [age] (Calculated from a birth date given by the user)
- [sexual identity] (multichoice, option to add identity)
- maybe therian and furry identities?: species (multichoice)
- [location] city/town
- [Country] (only essential stat) question just asks if they're in Scotland or not. If they don't live in Scotland they must have a 1st degree connection to be included, otherwise their data won't be saved or displayed. if they're outwith Scotland and have a connection, they will have a marker next to their node indicating what country they live in.

* Permissions (what's visible to other users)
there will be a default state that users can change at any time
- [username] is always [visible]
- [name] can be set to [visible] to:
  - 1st degree separation or [connection]s
  - 2nd degree separation or [metamore]s
  - [everyone] 


plan of action
1st. first of all, we'll need to figure out how to store the data
2nd. then build the website (somewhere between here and 1 the data vis stuff will need to be implimented. I don't know whether this should be database side, website side, or some third thing)
3rd. make the website able to access/pull data from the database
4th. make users able to create accounts
5th. make users able to input data into the database
